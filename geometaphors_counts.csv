I guess I was pretty sheltered (or naive, or both), but I saw nothing gendered about calling the blocks of resistant material ""knockers""  (this term's use in this context was pretty standard in the 1970s). When I started teaching (no longer in California), one of my colleagues objected strongly to the term ""knocker"" and only then did I understand that it had another context.

",Yes,"Not at all in professional contexts, or in formal/informal teaching contexts.  Mainly in student-designed T-shirts: e.g. ""Meet me behind the outcrop, baby.  I'm a little boulder there"" which is certainly sexual, but I would argue, not gendered (and, incidentally, hilarious).

I'm sure I have - I've been near the Tetons, for example - but I'm having trouble remembering any and I'm not sure I would necessarily recognize them as gendered/sexual - ""mastodon?"" I fully support the efforts to change place names using ""squaw"" and other words offensive from a BIPOC point of view. ",Yes,"Thankfully, it's been many years since I saw a talk at a professional meeting that featured (non-relevant) images of scantily clad women, but I'm old enough to remember those and realistic enough to guess that they haven't disappeared entirely.

One of my first memories from a national meeting (1970,  I think) was seeing a panel of men speaking at one of the sessions and complaining that their wives had suddenly started objecting to their being gone in the field for 6 months at a time. 

I guess I could add that as an undergrad I was treated just like all of the other students.  There were 2 women (of 6 total) in my graduating class.  When I got to graduate school, it was a bit of a shock to be in an environment where gender was noticed and some casual sexual comments were made, though not necessarily directed at any woman in particular - just part of the atmosphere.  I didn't experience any sexism from the faculty or the other students, but in at least one incident off campus, I was dismissed as a source of geological information because my research partner (a guy who wasn't there) was clearly seen as the only expert.  

Another thing I could add is:  There were no tenured or tenure-track women faculty in the geology grad program at that time.  Towards the end of my grad school days, a group of us formulated a survey about gender perceptions and distributed it to at least the faculty and perhaps the grad students.  We were invited to meet with the department chair.  It was one of the first times that I felt the potential power of a group of women - 15-20 sitting on the floor of the office.  We clearly made the chair very uncomfortable, and I think that was a good thing, even though I now have second thoughts about the wisdom of sending out that survey   and even though it took even more years for a woman faculty member to be hired on tenure track.",Yes,"On maps:  ""Squaw Lake"" and similar",No,,No,,"Earth and Planetary Surface Processes/Geomorphology,Education,Other",archaeological geology; Soils (engineering soil mechanics in grad school; later teaching and research more like soil science),"Fieldwork,Labwork",,"Post-industrial era (post-1750 CE),Cenozoic (Quaternary, Neogene, Eogene)",,Other,retired from academia (faculty member),Woman or woman identified,,Female,,Straight,,White,,Not Hispanic or Latinx,,USA,USA

Male PhD advisor enlisting later-career female PhD student to assist on a class field trip because he said he was afraid of ""how it might look with two male professors leading the course and majority early-career female students"" in the class. The female PhD student, although she agreed to help, was unwilling to indulge in male PhD advisor's sexist rants during the trip. Female PhD student was subsequently ridiculed throughout the trip by the male PhD advisor and excluded from male advisor/professor and male PhD student drinking and trip planning meetings despite being expected to shoulder the weight of emotionally managing the male PhD advisor's dissatisfaction with the female class during the trip. The female students in the class noticed this behavior and made efforts to include the female PhD student.
