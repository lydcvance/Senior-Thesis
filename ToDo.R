#To Do
#1)Fix counts on Graphs
#2)Replicate graphs for all the questions and for each question, do each demographic? Unless you can find a better way
#3)Create a subset of yes or no responses for questions and see if there is anything of note
#4)Clean your script so it runs smoothly, is annotated well, and makes sense (maybe make multiple scrips if needed)
